Every week i get dozen of messages with people asking me to make a roblox clone for them. I dont make roblox clones. So i made one for them to use.

100% Free, only condition is to credit me, or not at all, just dont go around saying you made it.

You could also edit the source code of the frontend etc... it is really easy.
